## 🚀 How to Deploy with GitHub Pages

Follow these steps to host your static HTML files using GitHub Pages:

1. **Create a GitHub repository** and push your HTML files to it.
2. Go to your repository on GitHub.
3. Click **Settings** (top menu).
4. In the left sidebar, scroll down to **Pages**.
5. Under **Build and deployment**, choose:
   - **Source**: `Deploy from a branch`
   - **Branch**: `main` or `master`
   - **Folder**: `/ (root)`
6. Click **Save**.
7. After a few seconds, GitHub will provide a public URL like:

```
https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/path/to/file.html
```

## ✅ Notes

- Ensure your repository is **public** so GitHub Pages can serve your files.
- GitHub Pages serves static files only (`.html`, `.css`, `.js`, etc.).
- You can create a landing page by placing an `index.html` in the root directory.
